I am Shawnee, I am a web developer. I have more than 6 years of coding experience 
back in Australia. I can work on both front end and back end, but my interests and 
focus is on the front end. HTML, CSS and javascript. Especially javacript, I have
experience with both using framework and vanilla javacript. With Frameworks, mainly 
React js and redux or apollo to pair with, Jquery when I first started writing code,
some exposure to Angular, polymore and Vue js.

My previous employer is called realestate.com.au(a property listing platform, the equverlant of Zillow in US). They have Australia's no.1 online
community for properties. It provides a listing directory for the buyers as 
well as relavant information you need to buy a property such as suburb profile, 
price trend and home loan options.

My team at Rea takes care of the two most important pages of the website. search
result page and property detail page. Goal is to enhance the user experience.

My last project is call smart hide. It allows the users to hide the listings they 
see a lot and not intereted from listing page, review and unhide them from their 
user collection dashboard. 

So the implementation includes two parts: 
1. To be able to hide the listings from either search result page
2. To be able to navigate to collection page wherever they at on the wensite

I am in charge of building the node module
Since our module users have different module systems of their code bases.
One is using es6 modules systems on the frontend, and nodejs, so commonjS on the backend. the other one is using AMD, backend use node, which uses commonJs
"The main difference between AMD and CommonJS lies in its support for asynchronous module loading."

expose es module: package.json main: module index.js type:modules

So two builds, UMD and es modules, nodejs can build, es6 can tree shak
